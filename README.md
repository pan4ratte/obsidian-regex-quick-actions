# Regex Quick Actions

English | [Русский](https://github.com/pan4ratte/obsidian-regex-quick-actions/blob/main/README_RU.md)

This plugin allows you to create regex actions and quickly apply them in different contexts in Obsidian. The plugin was created for automation purposes, so it is compatible with such plugins, as [Commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander).

Regex Quick Actions is a continuation of the idea of [Regex Pipeline](https://github.com/No3371/obsidian-regex-pipeline) plugin. While the base of the code was borrowed from it, now almost every line is original. Still, cheers to them for the inspiration and for making a quick start of this project possible.
