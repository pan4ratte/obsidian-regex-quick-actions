# Regex Quick Actions

This plugin allows you to create regex actions and quickly apply them in different contexts in Obsidian. The plugin was created for automation purposes, so it is compatible with such plugins, as `Commander`. Regex Quick Actions is a continuation of the idea of the Regex Pipline plugin. The base of the code was borrowed from it, but basically every feature was either deleted of significantly refined and modernized.


## Features

1. Create regex quick actions and use them:

	- From the command palette.
	- From the context menu of the file in the file explorer (default action).
	- From the context menu of the folder in the file explorer (default action, applies to all files in the folder).

2. Set a default action for quick use.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Add a possibility to create regex sequences to use multiple regex quick actions at once.

- [ ] Add Russian language localization.

- [ ] Add settings export/import option.
