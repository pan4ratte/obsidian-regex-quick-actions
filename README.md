# Regex Quick Actions

This is a plugin that allows to create Regex rules and then to apply them quickly: in the Obsidian file explorer (file context menu), note context menu, command palette. Quick actions integration is ensured with such pluging as `Commander`.

`Regex Quick Actions` is a continuation of the idea of the `Regex Pipline` plugin. The base of the code was borrowed from it, but basically every feature was either deleted of significantly refined and modernized.
